=======
This is a change from rStudio

Problems 
1. I had to install git and connect my rstudio to github
2. For some reason we didn't have to authorize the commit, it just immediately changed the file

>**_This is a line from RStudio -gabriel_**
### More problems:
  * We had to do a 'git config pull.rebase false' before we could pull
  * We had to generate a personal access token and install the gitcreds package
